# Competitive-Programming
Repository for hosting my solutions to competitive programming competitions, with the majority of problems taken from LeetCode &amp; Katis

Inside each directory is both a description of the programming problem, along with the implementatation. 
1. Numbered directories correspond to LeetCode daily problems / general LeetCode problems.
2. Titled directories correspond to programming competition submissions, or longer programming challenges that take place over mutiple days.
3. Some programming competitions are exclusive to the Milwaukee School of Engineering, this is usually mentioned within their description file

I typically use Python for competitive programming because it is quick to write in. It also helps me organize my thoughts easier than other languages.

You're free to use any of the code solutions given the following conditions:
1. You give credit if the solutions are unmodified or copy/pasted
2. You do not use these solutions to cheat in real competitions

If you're an employer and would like to use these problems for technical interviews, you must check first with the supplier of the problems. The problems are not designed by me, only the solutions.
